### What is it?

Ice is an AI bot that learns from data, including:

- Lines said in Movies
- Inspirational quotes

From this, it uses the [Spark](https://github.com/KingPixil/spark) library to generate a new sentence from [this](https://github.com/kbrsh/ice/blob/master/data/data.txt) data. It does this every 15 minutes to be precise, and will tweet out the sentence [@TheIceBot](https://twitter.com/TheIceBot).
